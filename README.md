# jsonrpclib

This is a cross-platform, cross-scala-version library that provides construct for bidirectional communication using the [jsonrpc](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) protocol. It is built on top of [fs2](https://fs2.io/#/) and [jsoniter-scala](https://github.com/plokhotnyuk/jsoniter-scala)

This library does not enforce any transport, and can work on top of stdin/stdout or other channels.

## Installation

The dependencies below are following [cross-platform semantics](http://youforgotapercentagesignoracolon.com/).
